<p style="margin:4px 0;"><strong>🐾 <span style="color:#ff9a00;">Sunny</span> &amp; <span style="color:#ED985F;">Sandy</span> – The Sweetest Mother–Son Duo You’ll Ever Meet!</strong></p>

<p style="margin:4px 0;">Meet <strong>Sunny</strong>, the bright orange sunbeam, and <strong>Sandy</strong>, his gorgeous creamy brown mama the color of soft beach sand. This adorable bonded pair is searching for a loving forever home they’ll light up every single day.</p>

<p style="margin:4px 0;"><strong>🌞 <span style="color:#ff9a00;">Sunny</span> – Your Little Ray of Joy</strong></p>
<p style="margin:4px 0;">Sunny shines just like his name – affectionate, curious, and endlessly sweet. He’s a soft, sweet kitten who couldn’t harm a thing. He happily follows his mom around and is learning his own little spark of independence. He’s gentle, expressive, and full of charm in that way only a young orange boy can be.</p>

<p style="margin:4px 0;"><strong>🏖️ <span style="color:#ED985F;">Sandy</span> – The Calming, Loving Mama</strong></p>
<p style="margin:4px 0;">Sandy is a creamy brown beauty with a warm, peaceful presence. She’s a loving, mellow mama who enjoys being held, petted, and close to her humans. She’s the perfect blend of affectionate and independent – she’ll gladly cuddle, and she also loves sleeping nearby whenever you sleep, keeping quiet watch over her people. She’s incredibly gentle, calm, and well-mannered.</p>

<p style="margin:4px 0;"><strong>🍗 Great Eaters, Great Manners</strong></p>
<p style="margin:4px 0;">Both are very food-motivated, which makes bonding (and training!) easy. They are exceptionally well-behaved, tidy, and sweet-natured – a great fit for first-time cat parents or anyone wanting a peaceful, loving pair.</p>

<p style="margin:4px 0;"><strong>💛 Why They Must Stay Together</strong></p>
<p style="margin:4px 0;">Sunny and Sandy share a heartwarming bond. Sunny looks to his mom for comfort and confidence, and Sandy enjoys caring for him – even when she appreciates a little “me time.” They complement each other perfectly and bring a warm, calming presence to any home. <strong>They must be adopted together, and the family who chooses them will be very lucky.</strong></p>
